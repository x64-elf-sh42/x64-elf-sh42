- 👋 Hi, I’m @x64-elf-sh42
- 👀 I’m interested in operating system development for x86_64 (AMD64)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning APIC/MSI-X/NVMe
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing
- 📫 email: sh4224hs@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: ChatGPT recommended C over Rust for my programs as C is timeless and Rust is immature, extremely verbose for low level things (kernel) and the community can't agree on anything. Fucking love AI.
